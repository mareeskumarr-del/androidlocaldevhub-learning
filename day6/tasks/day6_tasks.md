### Task A — Aggregate Records
Create a file named:
```
Day6.java
```
Program requirements:
- Use the in-memory records created in Day 5 (ArrayList or arrays)
- Traverse all stored records
- Calculate:
  - Total milk quantity (double)
  - Total cost (double)
- Aggregation must be derived **only** from stored records (no recalculation during input)
---
### Task B — Count Entries
- Count total number of records entered for the day
- Store this value as total deliveries
- Preserve insertion order of records
---
### Task C — Print Daily Summary
After aggregation, print exactly:
```
Daily Summary
Total Quantity: <totalQuantity>
Total Deliveries: <totalDeliveries>
Total Cost: <totalCost>
```
Values must reflect **all stored records** accurately.
---
### Task D — Save Output

- Save terminal output into:
```
