# Day 2 — Java Variables, Data Types, and User Input

## 1. Today’s Build Tasks

### Task A — Create a new Java file

Create a file named:

```
Day2.java
```

Inside the file:

- Declare one `String`
- Declare one `int`
- Declare one `double`
- Assign meaningful values
- Print them exactly in this format:

```
Title: Beginner
Score: 95
Balance: 120.5
```

(Values may differ, format must not.)

### Task B — Accept user input

Use Java `Scanner`:

```
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
```

Ask the user for:

* Name
* Age

Print the result exactly like:

```
You entered: <name>, <age>
```

---

### Task C — Verify execution

Compile the program:

```
javac Day2.java
```

Run the program:

```
java Day2
```

Ensure:

* Variables print correctly
* User input is read correctly
* Output format matches requirements

## 2. Learning Resources

Search on YouTube:

```
Java variables and data types
Java Scanner input example
```

Watch one short video (5–10 minutes total).

No extra material.
