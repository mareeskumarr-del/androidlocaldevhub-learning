# Day 3 — Java Conditionals and Decision Making

## 1. Today’s Build Tasks

### Task A — Create Day3.java

Create a file named:

```
Day3.java
```

Program requirements:

- Ask the user for a customer’s milk quantity (double)
  
- If quantity > 1.0 → print:
  

```
Large order
```

- Else if quantity == 1.0 → print:

```
Standard order
```

- Else → print:

```
Small order
```

---

### Task B — Add Billing Check

- Ask user for rate per liter (double)
  
- Calculate total cost: `total = quantity * rate`
  
- Print:
  

```
Total cost: <total>
```

---

### Task C — Save Output

- Run the program with at least 3 test cases
  
- Save terminal output into:
  

```
output/day3_output.txt
```

---

## 2. Learning Resources

Topics:

- `if`, `else if`, `else`
  
- Comparison operators
  
- Basic arithmetic in Java
  
- Input handling
  

---

## 3. Setup Checklist

Compile:

```
javac Day3.java
```

Run:

```
java Day3
```

Verify:

- Conditional outputs are correct
  
- Total cost calculation is correct
  
- Output matches required format

```
Day3.java
day3_output.txt
```

Save terminal output to:

```
output/day3_output.txt
```
