### Task A — Create Day8.java
Create a file named:
```
Day8.java
```
Program requirements:
* Use the in-memory records from Day 5
* Write all records to a file (txt or csv format)
* Each record must include:
  * Milk quantity
  * Rate per liter
  * Entry cost
* File format must be deterministic and consistent
* Order of records must be preserved exactly
---
### Task B — Write Daily Totals
* After writing all records, write a summary section to the same file:
  * Total milk quantity
  * Total deliveries
  * Total cost
* Totals must be derived by iterating over stored records
---
### Task C — Verify Persistence
* After writing the file:
  * Read the file manually (do not parse yet)
  * Confirm data is human-readable
  * Confirm no missing or reordered records
---
### Task D — Save Output
* Run the program with at least 3 records
* Save terminal output into:
```
output/day8_output.txt
```
* Save data file into:
```
data/day8_records.txt
```
(or equivalent deterministic filename)
